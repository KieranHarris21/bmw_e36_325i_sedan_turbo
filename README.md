1992 BMW 325i car mod for Assetto Corsa

Generated a realistic torque curve and made some changes to the game files for each track so that the power is adjusted based on altitude and temperature.
Added a turbo charger to simulate what it would be like to drive one of these cars if it was turbocharged.
Used some 3rd party tools to generate a few different sets of tires for the car (street, old street, semislick) for use in different simulations.
Made some other settings available in the setup screen in game such as the rev limiter, limited slip diff, turbo boost pressure and differential final drive ratio for use in different simulation senarios.
